      "title": "Spaghetti Carbonara",
      "ingredients": "200g spaghetti, 100g pancetta, 2 large eggs, 50g Pecorino cheese, 50g Parmesan, 2 plump garlic cloves, 50g unsalted butter, sea salt and freshly ground black pepper",
      "instructions": "1. Put a large saucepan of water on to boil. 2. Finely chop the pancetta, having first removed any rind. 3. Finely grate both cheeses and mix them together. 4. Beat the eggs in a medium bowl, season with a little freshly grated black pepper and set everything aside. 5. Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add the spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked). 6. Squash the garlic with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it. 7. While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. 8. Drop the butter into the pan and, when melted, remove from the heat and discard the garlic. 9. Save some of the pasta water and drain the spaghetti. 10. Quickly put the pasta into the pan with the pancetta. 11. Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later. 12. Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. 13. Quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. 14. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated. 15. Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy. 16. Season with a little salt, if needed. 17. Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or into a bowl. 18. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper."
